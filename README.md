# DMS
Basic Model of Discrete Maths visualized using code
This is one of the first attempts to bring Code in Mathematical Structures.
The problem statement here is Given a digraph as an input(either an Image or some simulation not int the form of an adjacency lidt or Matrix) give the Relations,set and check wether 
it is a partial order or Not.

So we used OpenCv Mouse click to achieve this,there was a window popped out and we gave the input as Digraph and then our code would show the results as required Output.
